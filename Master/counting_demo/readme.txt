Counting Demo:

Currently the there are only 3 hardcoded triangles in the mesh enumerated [0,1,2] and the demo runs step by step so you can count the particles and confirm the counting in the terminal is correct. 

Next thing to do is to be able to pass a non hard-coded triangulation into the mesh (read from a txt or something).

counting_demo.py is easy to read and pretty intuitive. Should give you an idea of the functionality of the mesh class if you don't know already.

mesh.py is currently AIDS to read at the moment though (but it works). (sorry). Will clean up some time.
