This is a demo for the randGenerate function, just to prove it works bug free.
It will show the normalized histogram of the results with normalized pdf superimposed on it.
The demo can read txt files such as matlab output for the pdf. Just select 3 and rename your txt to 'normdist.txt'
Of course, the default normdist.txt in this folder already contains a normal distribution function from matlab.
Have fun.
